# **004/feat/Triplanar Mapping**

This feature applies textures to the terrain in a way that avoids distortions and ensures seamless transitions between surfaces, even on complex or steep terrain. Triplanar mapping uses three projected textures (along the X, Y, and Z axes) and blends them together based on the surface normals, creating a consistent and visually pleasing appearance. This technique is particularly useful for terrains with varying elevations and angles, where traditional UV mapping would cause stretching or misalignment of textures.

## **User Stories**

- As a user, I want the terrain textures to look consistent and natural, without visible stretching or distortion, so the environment feels realistic and immersive.
- As a user, I want textures to blend smoothly between different surfaces (e.g., flat ground, slopes, and cliffs), so there are no abrupt transitions or visual artifacts.
- As a developer, I want to use triplanar mapping to apply textures dynamically, so they adapt to changes in the terrain mesh (e.g., user modifications or procedural updates).
- As a developer, I want to configure the texture blending parameters (e.g., sharpness, scale, and texture sets) to achieve different visual styles or match specific art directions.

## **Acceptance Criteria**

- Textures are applied to the terrain using triplanar mapping, ensuring no visible stretching or distortion on slopes or complex surfaces.
- Texture blending between the X, Y, and Z projections is seamless, with no visible seams or abrupt transitions.
- The triplanar mapping shader dynamically adjusts to changes in the terrain mesh (e.g., user modifications or procedural updates).
- Texture scale and sharpness can be adjusted through a configuration file or UI sliders.
- Multiple texture sets (e.g., grass, rock, sand) can be applied and blended based on terrain elevation or slope angle.
- The shader performance is optimized to maintain a smooth frame rate (e.g., 60 FPS) on mid-range devices.
- The feature integrates seamlessly with other terrain-related features, such as heightmaps, procedural mesh generation, and user modifications.
- Documentation is provided for developers to understand how to configure and extend the triplanar mapping system.
