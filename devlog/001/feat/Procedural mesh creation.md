# User Stories

- As a user, I want a terrain mesh to be generated automatically when the application starts, so I have a starting point to explore and interact with.
- As a user, I want the terrain to look natural with realistic features like hills, valleys, and flat areas, so the environment feels immersive.
- As a developer, I want the mesh generation to be configurable in size and resolution, so it can adapt to different performance and visual requirements.
- As a developer, I want the procedural mesh to integrate seamlessly with other features, such as heightmaps, triplanar mapping, and user modifications.

# Acceptance criteria

- A terrain mesh is generated automatically on application start.
- The mesh includes variations in height to represent natural topography.
- There are no visible artifacts or errors in the generated mesh.
- Perlin or simplex noise is used for procedural generation.
- Elevation values are calculated dynamically using adjustable parameters such as frequency and amplitude.
- Users can modify generation parameters through a configuration file or UI sliders.
- Users can specify the width, length, and height of the terrain before generation.
- The resolution of the mesh can be adjusted (e.g., low, medium, high detail).
- Changes to the configuration are reflected in the generated mesh within 1-2 seconds.
- The generated mesh includes basic visual differentiation between elevation levels (e.g., a color gradient).
