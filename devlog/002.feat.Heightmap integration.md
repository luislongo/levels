# 002/feat/Heightmap integration

This feature enables the terrain mesh to incorporate elevation data from grayscale heightmap images. By mapping pixel intensity values to elevation, the terrain achieves a high level of detail and realism. Users can upload custom heightmap images to generate unique landscapes, while developers benefit from seamless integration with procedural generation and user-modifiable features. Heightmaps offer a foundation for creating diverse terrain types, such as mountains, valleys, and plains, with precision and visual clarity.

## User Stories

- **As a developer**, I want to upload a heightmap image to define the terrain's elevation so that I can create custom landscapes.
- **As a developer**, I want the application to automatically scale the heightmap to fit the terrain size and resolution so that the entire image is represented on the mesh.
- **As a developer**, I want to visualize the heightmap application in real time so that I can immediately see how it affects the terrain.
- As a developer, I want the heightmap to be generated based on previously implemented noise generation

## Acceptance Criteria

- The application dynamically applies the heightmap to the terrain upon upload, updating the mesh within 1-2 seconds.
- Pixel intensity values from the heightmap are correctly mapped to elevation, with adjustable scaling for height amplification.
- Heightmap data is interpolated to match the terrain resolution, ensuring smooth and natural transitions between elevation points.
- Heightmap is generated with procedural noise to add finer details or overlays to the terrain.
- There are no visible artifacts or distortions in the generated mesh due to heightmap processing.
