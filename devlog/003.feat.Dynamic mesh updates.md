# 003/feat/Dynamic Mesh Updates

This feature allows users to modify the terrain mesh in real time through interactive tools. Users can raise, lower, or flatten specific areas of the terrain dynamically, creating customized landscapes without restarting or regenerating the entire mesh. The updates are processed efficiently to ensure smooth, real-time feedback, while maintaining compatibility with heightmaps, procedural generation, and other rendering features.
