# 003/feat/Dynamic Mesh Updates

This feature allows users to modify the terrain mesh in real time through interactive tools. Users can raise, lower, or flatten specific areas of the terrain dynamically, creating customized landscapes without restarting or regenerating the entire mesh. The updates are processed efficiently to ensure smooth, real-time feedback, while maintaining compatibility with heightmaps, procedural generation, and other rendering features.

## User Stories

- **As a user**, I want to modify the terrain by raising or lowering areas in real time so that I can create custom features like hills or valleys.
- **As a user**, I want visual feedback as I interact with the terrain, such as highlighting the affected area, so I know exactly what will be modified.
- **As a user**, I want the terrain to update seamlessly without lag, ensuring a smooth and immersive experience.
- **As a developer**, I want an efficient system to update only affected parts of the mesh, optimizing performance for real-time interaction.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can modify the terrain mesh interactively by raising, lowering, or flattening specific areas.
- The size and intensity of the modification tools are adjustable via a UI or configuration.
- Visual indicators (e.g., a circular brush outline) show the area being modified before changes are applied.
- Changes to the mesh are rendered in real time with a response time of less than 100ms to ensure smooth interaction.
- Updates to the terrain do not disrupt or overwrite heightmap data unless explicitly chosen by the user.
